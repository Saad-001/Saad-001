<br >

Mastering programming and coding well has always been a challenge, especially for those hailing from a different background. And I eagerly embraced this challenge! Graduating from Hathazari Madrasah in 2018 was the beginning of my journey into programming languages and web development technologies. Now, It's been nearly four years since I started this journey, and I've consistently strived toward my goal of becoming a proficient web developer, conquering milestones one after another along the way. Thus, I'm acquiring proficiency in the JavaScript ecosystem, and my enthusiasm for it knows no bounds.

#### How I Code?

My coding approach revolves around breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable pieces. I prioritize adhering to the DRY principle, ensuring code efficiency, and making frequent commits. Additionally, I emphasize commenting where necessary and strive to align with community best practices.
